# HashLR: Hash Layout Randomization

An improvement over address space layout randomization (ASLR) that shuffles the layout of basic blocks in the text section of an executable binary file instead of using a fixed offset. This makes it harder for attackers to predict the location of code in memory. Unlike previous attempts at using lookup tables to implement this shuffling, HashLR uses a hash function to perform the shuffling at runtime without the need for memory access.

## Usage

In the [LLVM project repo](https://github.com/mtarunpr/llvm-project), to compile LLVM with the additional X86HashLR pass:

```bash
cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86
ninja -C build
```

In this repo, to compile (to LLVM) the code you want to run the pass on (say `tests/five_functions/five_functions.c`),
and then compile the LLVM to assembly code (including the additional X86HashLR pass):

```bash
clang -S -emit-llvm -o tests/five_functions/five_functions.ll tests/five_functions/five_functions.c -arch x86_64
/path/to/llvm/repo/build/bin/llc  tests/five_functions/five_functions.ll -o tests/five_functions/five_functions-hashlr.S  > tests/five_functions/five_functions-hashlr_bb_identifiers.txt
```

Note that we redirect the output of `llc` (the identifiers of the basic blocks)
to a text file so that we can use it in the objdump parser script.

To compare with the original assembly code generated by LLVM:

```bash
clang -S -o tests/five_functions/five_functions.S tests/five_functions/five_functions.c -arch x86_64
```

To compile the HashLR version of the assembly code to an executable binary file:

```bash
clang -o tests/five_functions/five_functions-hashlr tests/five_functions/five_functions-hashlr.S -arch x86_64
```

To compile the hashLR injector and mmapper:

```bash
g++ src/injector.cpp -o src/injector
g++ src/mmapper.cpp -o src/mmapper
```

To run the HashLR version of the executable:

```bash
./src/injector tests/five_functions/five_functions-hashlr tests/five_functions/five_functions-hashlr_bb_identifiers.txt
```
